## Agile Workflow

![](https://github.com/arthurvguide/ask-japanese/blob/main/docs/screenshots/kanban-board.JPG)
I've tried to implement the basic Agile strategy, creating issues for my user stories, a Kanban board for the project, Milestones for each epic and moving the stories from TO DO to, PROGRESS to DONE.

As Github is limited with ways to do this, I have chosen to have the Milestones as Epics instead of sprints in this project.
The Kanban board can be viewed [here](https://github.com/arthurvguide/ask-japanese/projects/1).
